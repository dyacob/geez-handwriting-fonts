# Geʾez Handwriting Fonts

This repository project attempts the continuation of the original font work by [Educational Fonts, Inc.](https://www.educationalfontware.com/) that help in teaching of handwriting to children who speak languages that are written in the Geʾez (aka “Ethiopic”) script. 

## Background
The Educational Fonts company developed a collection of 14 fonts that illustrate the sequence and direction of written strokes needed to form the Geʾez letters. The collection was developed over a two year period and released in 2011 under the [Open Font License](OFL.txt) (OFL). The motivation behind developing the font collection was for use in Ethiopia and Eritrea elementary school education.  The collection was provided to the respective governments, however, the extent of their utilization is unknown.

## Goals
The primary goal of this project is to extend the font with the Ethiopic letters that have been added to the Unicode Standard since the release of the original font collection.  A [compantion project](https://github.com/geezorg/learn-to-write-geez-books) has the aim of developing primer books in various languages that employ the fonts to teach writing.
